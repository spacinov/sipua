The ``sipua`` project provides a library for writing SIP user agents in Python,
with a focus on correctness and composability. It can be used to write clients,
servers or proxies.

Its features include:

- A transport layer supporting UDP, TCP and WebSocket.
- A transaction layer for stateful user agents and proxies.
- An RTP and RTCP stack with optional support for `ICE`_ and `DTLS-SRTP`_.
